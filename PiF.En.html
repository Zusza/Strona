            Petruccio - the youngest of the Auditore children, was described shortly after birth <br/>by Giovanni Auditore in a letter to Lorenzo de' Medici as "poorly built".
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Apparently nothing has changed over time. Petruccio was taken from school due to illness when he was 12 years old and according to the doctor's records he was bedridden. After this time, there is no information about him, so it can be assumed that he did not manage to get out of it unscathed.

            Ezio's older brother and eldest Auditore, Federico, started working as a clerk <br/>at the Medici Bank at the age of 19. However, bank records state that<br/>most of the time he was slacking instead of working.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            One entry contains more data. On September 17, 1475, a purse of gold florins disappeared. "As panic seized the bank, the senior auditore approached Francesco Sassetti and, smiling, told him where the purse was. It turned out to be hidden on the roof! If he had not been the son of Giovanni Auditore, I would have spoken to Lorenzo de' Medici and had him put in the stocks! ".
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Of course, Federico was fired from the bank just after his 20th birthday.
