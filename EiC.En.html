            <br/>
            In a diary entry from 1474, Maria Auditore, one of the greats the chroniclers <br/>of Florence and Ezio's mother, describes her son as "liking competitive, <br/>stubborn and saucy, yet so committed in what he does that it's hard to <br/>blame him for anything." Complaints made to of the city guard by <br/>numerous noblewomen suggest that he was an extraordinary womanizer.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            His teacher was the great banker Giovanni Tornabuoni. Records of Ezio's school years end with his 17th year, when his name appears in the context of a heinous crime.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            There is no exact information about it in the archives, but then Ezio disappears from the pages of history as if he never existed.

            Giovanni and Maria Auditore's third child and first girls in the family, <br/>Claudia was probably a spoiled brat. It seems that her parents had to <br/>increase her dowry by 1000 florins after she scared off all the candidates.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            A report from her school said that she once attacked a certain young man she was dating because he looked at another girl... and knocked him unconscious. On the other hand, she's Ezio's sister, so you should be safe.
