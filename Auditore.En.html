            <c><b>House of Auditore</b></c> - Florentine noble family,<br/> in which father Giovanni, daughter Claudia and son Ezio were Assassins.
            <p><b>The history of the <br/>Auditore family</b></p><img src="Auditorecrest.webp"/><br/>
            Text taken from the tablets in the tomb of the Auditore in Monterrigioni.<br/>
            <br/>
            <c><b>Venice 1296</b></c><br/>
            was raised in a small house on the Venetian lagoon, overlooking the foaming waves of the sea. As soon as I could walk, I became a sailor. I sailed the Atlantic, first as an apprentice, then carrying cargo for Messer Marco Polo, my father's patron. It was a good life.
            <br/>
            <br/><c><b>Coast</b></c><br/>
            One day I was looking for a job in the port and... I fell in love. She was only twenty summers, but when I looked into her eyes, I saw the whole world, sharper and brighter than the sun. Then I still went to sea, but my heart stayed on land, with this girl who became my wife, and with our son.
            <br/>
            <br/><c><b>Firstborn</b></c><br/>
            One afternoon that summer, Messer Polo called me into his office. My father was already there, and next to him an elderly man wearing a strange hooded cloak was watching us.
            In that moment my whole life changed, my father told me I was an Assassin. He took off his signet ring and showed me a strange birthmark on his finger, explaining that our family belongs to an ancient order that protects humanity.
            He paused, and then, while I was silent, Messer Polo came up to me. He said that the man in the hood would be my teacher, and in return I would take him across the Mediterranean to Spain. And so I began my apprenticeship with Dante Alighieri and lost everything that made me happy.
            <br/>
            <br/><c><b>Mentor</b></c><br/>
            Messer Alighieri often met with me in preparation for the trip. At first it was just about buying supplies, but soon we were talking about more important things: life, love, honor and justice.
            He taught me that society was organized so that its members could be controlled. Yes, to prevent us from thinking and seeing. Soon I was able to see through all the laws and illusions. I understood that humanity was exploited by rulers and that we humans deserve freedom.
            Then Dante began to show me pages from the book that Messe Polo had brought from the palace of the great Genghis Khan. This manuscript, called the Codex, described our order.
            An unexpected breakup
            Our planned trip did not materialize. Dante died returning to Ravenna for the rest of his belongings. Saddened by the loss of my mentor, I went to deliver the bad news to my father and Messer Polo. Before I could say anything, I was dragged into the study, and my pale father closed the door behind me.
            Shocked, I silently listened to his words. Dante wanted to take the Codex to Spain where it would be safe. But we were being watched. The enemies of the Assassins, the Templars, still existed.
            I remember him telling me stories about the Templars and I understood everything. Dante was murdered. the templars knew about the Codex and about us. My jittery father told me to take the Codex and leave immediately for Spain with my wife and child. As Messer Polo urged me to the door, he handed me a small piece of paper with a number written on it. Thanks to this scrap, I was able to use his credit. I have never seen so many ducats in all my life in any bank in Italy.
            <br/>
            <br/><c><b>At sea</b></c><br/>
            We sailed the same night, the ship was loaded with goods for sale in the markets of Barcelona. Everything was going well at first. Then, to avoid the approaching storm, we anchored in the port of Otranto. Under the cover of darkness, the pirates appeared. I didn't notice them until they were boarding my ship.
            I hid in the hold with my family. I pulled out the Codex, touched the worn leather with my hands, and suddenly the spine fell apart. The cards fell silently to the floor. I stuffed them in trunks, chests and containers that I was supposed to sell.
            The people who found us were drunk, I could feel it in their breath. When they asked for the Codex, I guessed who sent them. Suppressing my anger, I said I had thrown him overboard.
            They started laughing. Two of them held me down, chuckling, the others cut my wife's clothes. She begged for mercy until her voice broke. When they were done, they threw her into the sea.
            They took my cargo, sank the ship, and left me adrift on a piece of rail.
            I went to the beach with my son. The next morning, the tide washed up my wife's body.
            <br/>
            <br/><c><b>A new name</b></c><br/>
            I never saw the sea again.
            Arriving in Florence, I rented a small room and went to the bank. I had a number engraved in my memory that Polo had once given me.
            With an enormous amount of money at my disposal, I went in disguise to Venice to look for my father. The next day I returned to Florence. Polo and my father were already dead.
            Since then, I have been collecting treatises on architecture, studying classical languages ‚Äã‚Äãand learning to sing. I took the name Auditore, pretending to be a nobleman from the Florentine court. They accepted me as their own, I took part in their intrigues and built this villa for me and my son.
            And then I started hunting them. I raised my son to be a warrior who will find the Codex and kill Templars. Together we will avenge my wife's honor and my father's death. These two accounts will never be evened out.
