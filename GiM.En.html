            Giovanni Auditore was one of the most important figures of the fifteenth century <br/> Florentine banking environment. As supervisor of banking houses di Medici <br/>was responsible for the efficient management of the whole the family's financial <br/>empire while Lorenzo was busy ruling. Extending his influence to foreign posts, <br/>he was the first who noticed problems in Lyon and alerted Francesco <br/>Sassettiego - his intervention averted the disaster.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Such great talent was properly rewarded. Giovanni developed a close friendship with Lorenzo de' Medici (Lawrence the Magnificent), becoming one of his closest advisors. The papal support for the Medici bank in 1471 was also the work of Giovanni.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Grateful and reassured, Lorenzo rewarded Giovanni by paying for his palace.

            She was born into a powerful family of bankers - the Mozzi. Mary is one <br/>of the most famous historical sources of this period thanks to her <br/>multi-volume a diary that has been translated by many famous people <br/>scientists and is on display at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.

            Thanks to her parents' funds, Maria opened a bakery in the courtyard of the family palazzo, which she transformed into a meeting place for artists. It was there that she met "a man so convincing that I couldn't move or take my eyes off him." That man was Giovanni Auditore.

            Maria and Giovanni married in 1450. Maria continued to write her diary for several decades. She describes how she became the patron of many artists, she also writes about the hardships of parenthood, and here her notes end, to the disappointment of all historians.
